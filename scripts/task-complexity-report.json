      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Card Marking and Win Detection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Card Marking and Win Detection task into 5 subtasks, focusing on server actions, UI components, algorithm implementation, and real-time event handling. Include specific technical details for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work with complex state management. The win detection algorithm requires careful implementation to check for completed rows in a 9x5 grid with blank cells. Real-time updates add another layer of complexity, requiring coordination between server actions and client-side event handling."

      "taskTitle": "Create Game Flow Management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Game Flow Management task into 6 subtasks covering the complete game lifecycle from initialization to reset. Include specific components, state transitions, and user interactions for each game state.",
      "reasoning": "This task manages the entire game lifecycle with multiple state transitions and complex UI components for different game states. It requires coordination between server actions and client components, with dependencies on previous tasks. The reset functionality adds complexity by requiring careful state management to preserve some data while clearing others."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive UI and Styling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Responsive UI and Styling task into 5 subtasks focusing on specific UI components, responsive layouts, accessibility features, and visual feedback mechanisms using Tailwind CSS.",
      "reasoning": "While primarily frontend work, this task requires careful implementation of responsive designs across multiple device sizes. The traditional 9x5 Lô Tô grid presents unique styling challenges, especially on mobile. Accessibility requirements and consistent styling add complexity, but the task is somewhat more straightforward than those involving game logic."

      "taskTitle": "Enhance Audio Experience",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Audio Experience enhancement task into 4 subtasks covering audio asset management, playback implementation, user controls, and integration with game events.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, involving audio asset management and integration with game events. The Vietnamese number calling adds some complexity, but the overall scope is narrower than other tasks. The AudioController component and preloading logic require careful implementation, but the task is relatively self-contained."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Connection Management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Error Handling and Connection Management task into 6 subtasks addressing different aspects of error handling, reconnection logic, state reconciliation, and user feedback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex error handling across both frontend and backend, with multiple dependencies. The reconnection logic and state reconciliation for real-time connections are particularly challenging. Implementing optimistic updates while maintaining consistency requires careful design. This cross-cutting concern affects multiple components and requires thorough testing."
